    I am Praveen Korukonda. My interest lies in Software Engineering with a focus on Backend. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee</a> in Mechanical Engineering in 2025. I previously worked as a SWE intern at <a href="https://planto.ai">Planto AI</a> and <a href="https://codingpro.online">CodingPro</a>.

    My hobby is software development. I love to create software that creates a big impact on others. I mostly code in Golang and occasionally in Java.

    I spend my free time reading books and playing vedio games.
