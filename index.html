    I am Praveen Korukonda. This place is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee</a> in Mechanical Engineering in 2025.

    My interest lies in Software Engineering with a particular focus on backend. I previously worked as a SWE intern at <a href="https://planto.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planto AI</a> and <a href="https://codingpro.online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodingPro</a>.
